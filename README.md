# Animations-with-MANIM
In this repository I am going to create animations using the MANIM library. 

TO SET DIFFERENT RENDERQUALITIES USE THIS: -pql (low) -pqm (medium) -pqh (high)

TO NOT PREVIEW THE RENDERED VIDEO REMOVE THE "p" FROM "-pql" --> "-ql"

TO RENDER YOUR GRAPHICS RUN THIS COMMAND IN THE TERMINAL: manim -pqh your_filename.py the_name_of_the_function_you_want_to_render
